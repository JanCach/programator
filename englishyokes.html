            <h3>Christmas and Halloween</h3>
            <p>
            Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween?<br>
            Because Oct 31 == Dec 25.

            <p>
            What is the difference between you and a calender?<br>
            A calender has dates.

            <p>
                Why did the computer keep freezing? <br>
                Because it left its Windows open.

                Wife: “You care about programming more than about me.“ <br>
                Husband: “Don’t worry, honey, in my array() of interests you are at position one.“

                Student: “Insomnia.“ <br>

            <p>
                No English word has double „OO“ except the word “FOOD“. Prove me wrong! <br>
                This is proof that preschool education is important in childhood and that choosing the right books and tools to learn is more important than Nollywood. For now, get a stool, go back to the classroom and learn some coordination. Don’t be a hooligan.

                Daughter: “No, mom, why?” <br>

            <p>
                A doctor and engineer loved the same girl. <br>
                The doctor used to give her a rose daily. The engineer used to give the girl an apple. <br>
                The girl got confused and asked: “There is a meaning of giving rose. Why are you giving an apple?” <br>
                The engineer answers: “An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.”

            <p>
                Why did the student solve multiplication problems on the floor? <br>
                Because the teacher told students not to use tables.
